Lab 5 


1. What I have correctly implemented: created a Google Map, parsed the data, displayed on the map where the Red Line trains are,  displayed on the map where you are. 
What I have not correctly implemented: asynchronous xmlhttp request because I couldn't retrieve JSON from the website due to the origin issue. 
What I did instead: I implemented my file to be able to do asynchronous request. But since I couldn't retrieve the data, I assign JSON data to a string and parse and put landmark from there. I marked which line will be change if I were given a link to a file that I can retrieve data from. 
2. I discussed with Saurav Acharya on this lab. 
3. It took me 5-6 hours to do this lab. It took really long this time because I was trying to fix the problem of different origin.
