I wrote the responsive css file for dynamic image manipulation based 
on screen limitation. 
1. All of the aspects of the work have been correctly implemented. 
2. I discussed problems I had with the TA and a comp sci student 
3. It took me 1.5 just to figure out the logistics. About an hour to code 
and debug
