1. I have implemented everything correctly. 
2. I worked independently on this project
3. It takes me roughly 11-12 hours to finish this project. 
4. Notes: 
I put the distance from the character to me in each character's info box. 

I figured out how to do most of my code from w3schools, stackoverflow, your examples, and google. 

I was mentioned that I am not allowed to use JQuery. In the window info box, 
I added the paragraph and bold tag to make the info box nicer. So I wonder if that's okay? 

I also have a lot of trouble with switching and merging from different branches in GitHub. 
In general, I wasted a lot of time on the logistic part, for example, getting used to Github, 
publishing the code to the webpage.
