1. I have implemented my project correctly. I can't make the title News... 
appear in the top though. I think it's not possible using just prepend and append . 
2. Other than discussing my assignment with Ming, I worked on my assignment independently. 
3. I spent around 4 hours on this assignment in total. 
4. Notes: this assignment is not that difficult. I used w3schools, Ming's Jquery's examples, 
and stackoverflow to help me on this assignment. I was surprised that I used stackoverflow a lot 
this time.
